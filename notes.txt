Preface
-------
- Can I use algorithm X to solve my problem?  If so, how do I implement it?
- Recommends the "1,180-page bible on algorithms", Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al. (2001)

Principle: Use Real Code, Not Pseudocode
Principle: Separate the Algorithm from the Problem Being Solved
- Quote: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" - C. A. R. Hoare
